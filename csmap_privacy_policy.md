We are committed to protecting your personal information and research participants (“you,”your”) right to privacy.

News Evaluation is a Chrome extension that collects browsing data from registered research participants who agree to be part of a study. To be part of a CSMaP study, a participant first completes a survey and opts-in to sharing web browsing data through the News Evaluation extension. This data will consist of the URL you visit and any of your search engine results from Google and/or AI assistants if you search for anything. Data collected through News Evaluation is anonymized and used for academic purposes only. The confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. Raw survey data will be held on an encrypted hard drive, separate from all other datasets. These hard drives will be stored in locked cabinets. Once anonymized, survey data will be stored on secure NYU servers.
