This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) pertains to the URL Historian Chrome extension (“extension”) provided by New York University’'s Center for Social Media and Politics (“CSMaP”, "Company," "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and research participants (“you,”your”) right to privacy. 

You have been invited to take part in a research study to help researchers at CSMaP understand how our ever-shifting online environment impacts politics, policy, and democracy.

URL Historian is a Chrome extension that collects browsing data from registered research participants who agree to be part of a study. To be part of a CSMaP study, a participant first completes a survey and opts-in to sharing web browsing data through the URL Historian extension. The participant is then provided a User ID and the Panel ID associated with the study. These IDs are required to register and use the URL Historian extension. 
Data collected through URL Historian is anonymized and used for academic purposes only. All collected data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and only accessible by CSMaP researchers. 

## What the extension collects

**Web browsing history**
<p>When the plug-in is registered and activated, it automatically begins collecting URLs visited. You can pause and resume data collection at any time through options on the extension interface. You can also block specific domains from being collected by adding the URLs of these domains to a blacklist feature within the extension. </p>

**Social Media Data**
<p>You can also opt-in to sharing data from popular social media websites. To contribute this data, you can toggle the following options: the Twitter option will collect tweet data when you visit twitter.com, the YouTube option will collect videos listed when visiting youtube.com, and the Facebook option will solely collect URLs that appear on your Facebook news feed when visiting facebook.com. This data is only collected if a you opt-in to add these sites. Each social media site is activated separately. Data will only be collected from the social media websites that you have opted-in to sharing.</p>


## Controlling what you share

**Pausing data collection**
<p>You can pause data collection using the pause toggle feature on the extension. This will pause all data collection until you toggle the pause control back to active.</p>

**Removing data** 
<p>You can revoke your shared data at any time. Within URL Historian, you can delete data that has been shared for up to ten days after it was collected.
