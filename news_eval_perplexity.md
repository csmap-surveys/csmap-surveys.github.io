 	<h2 id="howto">How do I use Perplexity?</h2>
	<p>To use Perplexity, simply type a question into the box at the center of the screen. The answer engine will then search the web and its knowledge base for relevant sources, synthesize them, and generate a summary. The response will often also include links to relevant source articles.</p>

<div class="extrapadding">
	<h2 id="howmany">How many questions can I ask?</h2>
	<p>Currently, the free version of Perplexity allows up to five separate questions before prompting you to create a membership. For your present task, you should only need to ask one question, but you are welcome to ask as many as you want.</p>

	<h2 id="account">Do I need to create an account?</h2>
	<p>You do not need to create an account with Perplexity in order to fulfill the task in this study. The free version is sufficient. If you are prompted to create an account, you are welcome to do so if you would like, but you are not required to do so.</p>

	<p>This is fine, if you were able to ask at least one question to Perplexity in order to evaluate the veracity of the central claim of the article. If Perplexity's paywall comes before you are able to productively use it to evaluate the article, please inform us using the contact information provided below to report the issue, and then proceed with the remainder of the survey to the best of your ability.</p>
