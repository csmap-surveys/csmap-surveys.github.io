This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) pertains to the CSMaP MASA app ("Masa app”) provided by New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics (“CSMaP”, “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to protecting your personal information and research participants (“you,”your”) right to privacy.

You have been invited to take part in a study to help political and social science researchers to understand how our ever-shifting online environment impacts politics, policy, and democracy.

## What the App collects
The following data is securely gathered from the participant mobile device using the [Passive data kit](https://passivedatakit.org) technology data and transmitted to the postgres storage server in Amazon Web Services(AWS). The data gathered include 
### App usage information
Time spent on any given app in participant device is gathered. However, only apps that the participant has granted us access are identifiable. For example if a participant has granted access to Facebook app, and accesses the Facebook and Chrome app in the same day, the MASA app will gather usage data from both apps but only the daily usage of Facebook app will be identified while that of the Chrome App will be hidden from the participant and the researchers. Time spent on specific apps that the participant has granted access for the study is displayed in the **USAGE** tab of the MASA app.

### Device information
The MASA app also gathers and transmits the participant mobile device information including battery level, internet connectivity, device screen and data transmission status. This information is gathered to allow the app to send data to the databases when the participant battery connectivity is at their best and also to resume data transmission when the battery or connectivity are restored to a better level.  

## Data storage and access
Data collected through the MASA app will be held on an encrypted postgres database in Amazon Web Services(AWS). Only approved researchers and app engineers will have access to the data. CSMaP will not share or sell your data to commercial third-parties. All data collected will be anonymized and used for research purposes only.
