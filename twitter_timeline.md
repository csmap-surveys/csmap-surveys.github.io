## Thank you for enrolling in a study by researchers at the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University. 

Your participation is helping us to learn more about how people use Twitter in the United States. 

You were assigned to the Twitter Timeline group. As part of this group in the study, **you will tell us about posts you see on your Twitter timeline.** 

**We expect you to use your Twitter as usual!**

**Remember, this intervention will last for four weeks.**


### You need to send Tweets from your timeline regularly for a month.

Over the course of the study, you can submit up to 10 screenshots for the maximum rewards.

1. Scroll through the Tweets on your timeline and see if you find anything interesting.

2. Each day, you will receive a link to a survey asking you to submit a link or a screenshot of a Tweet that you found interesting on your timeline. (For instructions on creating a screenshot on your current device, visit <a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/</a>.) 
3. You will also be asked to type a 1-2 sentence response about why you found the Tweet interesting.


#### Example 1: Screen capture of Tweet

<p align="center"><img src="images/twitter_screenshot_example.png" alt="screenshot of a Tweet where the author, tweet and likes and retweets options are included" width="400"></p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Example of a Tweet screenshot, this is all the info that needs to be included in the screenshot (To respect your privacy, we ask you not screen capture your entire desktop or Twitter interface.)</p>

#### Example 2: Copying link to Tweet

### Rewards can be earned as follows:

At the end of the four weeks, we will invite you to complete a 10-minute questionnaire. If you follow the study rules: submit Twitter screenshots or links through survey links you receive via email, and answer the final questionnaire, you will receive a gift card. The amount of the gift card depends on how many of the following tasks you are able to complete:

- Initial survey: $2
- Screenshots/links:
  - At least 10 screenshots/links: $8
  - Between 5 and 10 screenshots/links: $3
  - Less than 5 screenshots: no additional compensation
 - Final survey: $5

You can thus in total earn up to $15 (if you complete both surveys and send in at least 10 screenshots/links). If you choose only to complete part of the study, you will only be compensated for the tasks you completed.

### When will I see my rewards?
This study continues through June 22nd. We will screen submissions for completeness and distribute rewards within a week after that.
