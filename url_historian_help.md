	<h2 id="activate">How do I register and activate the extension?</h2>
	<p>You will receive a User ID and Survey ID when you complete a CSMaP survey and express interest in installing the URL Historian extension. These IDs will be shared in the survey or in an email after you complete the survey.</p>

<p>After you install the extension, you can access the URL Historian window by selecting the extension from the Chrome extension menu which can be accessed next to the address bar (puzzle piece icon).</p>
<ol>	
	<li>On the extension window, you will see a field to enter your User ID.</li>
<li>After entering your User ID, you will see a pop-up screen prompting you to enter your Survey ID.</li>
<li>After entering your Survey ID, the setup is complete. The extension will begin collecting your web history automatically.</li>
	</ol>
<p>The extension allows three registration attempts. After three failed registration attempts, the extension will uninstall automatically.</p>

	<h2 id="forget">Why does a popup window keep appearing after installing the extension?</h2>

	<h2 id="survey">How do I get a Survey ID and User ID?</h2>
	<p>Your <strong>survey ID</strong> is provided together with your <strong>user ID</strong> through either an email sent to you or through a link to install and activate the extension.</p>
	<p>Your Survey ID and User ID are provided in the survey and through email when you agree to install the extension. If you no longer have access to these codes, you can request a code by emailing <a href="mailto:csmap-surveys@nyu.edu">csmap-surveys@nyu.edu</a> and referencing where you completed the survey.</p>
	<p> The extension allows three login attempts. After three failed login attempts the extension will uninstall automatically. You can contact  <a href="mailto:csmap-surveys@nyu.edu">csmap-surveys@nyu.edu</a> for assistance.</p>

	<h2 id="uninstall">I got a failed activation error and the extension uninstalled itself, what should I do?</h2>
	<p>When you install the extension, you have three attempts to enter your User ID and Survey ID. If one of these codes was entered incorrectly or isn’t working, the extension will automatically uninstall. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:csmap-surveys@nyu.edu">csmap-surveys@nyu.edu</a> for assistance.

	<h2 id="remove">I no longer want to participate. How do I remove the extension from my Chrome browser?</h2>
	
	<p>You can remove the extension two ways.</p>
	<p>Through the Chrome browser:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the extension menu in your Chrome browser, located next to the address bar (puzzle piece icon).</li> 
<li>From the extensions menu, you will see URL Historian listed. Select the three dots next to the extension name to reveal a submenu. The submenu provides the option “Remove from Chrome…”  to uninstall the extension.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="html">What do the toggles next to the Twitter, Facebook and YouTube icons do?</h2>
	
The toggles next to the social media icons allow you to share data that appears on these websites. Sharing this data is optional and not required. Each social media site is activated separately. 
<ul>
	<li>The Twitter option will collect tweet data when you visit twitter.com.</li>
	<li>The YouTube option will collect videos listed when visiting youtube.com.</li>
	<li>The Facebook option will solely collect URLs that appear on your Facebook news feed when visiting facebook.com.</li> 
</ul>

		<video width="560" height="420" controls>
	  		<source src="videos/uh_page_content.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
	</p>


	<h2 id="pause">What options are available if there are times I don’t want to share data?</h2>
	<p>The toggle at the top left side of the extension window allows you to pause and resume data collection at any time. When the toggle is in “Active” state, the extension is collecting URLs for sites you visit.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Slide the toggle button to the left to pause data collection, and to the right to resume data collection.</li>
		<li>After the extension is paused for 60 minutes, a popup window will appear reminding you to resume activity. After the first reminder, follow-up reminders will appear every four hours.</li>
	</ol>		


 	<h2 id="delete">Is there a way to delete data that I didn’t mean to share?
</h2>
	
	<p>Within URL Historian, you can delete shared data for up to ten days after it was collected.</p>

	<p>The Delete Browse History feature allows you to delete data by Time or by Date.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>By Time allows you to delete data by the hour.</li>
		<li>By Date allows you to delete data for the days you select.</li>
	</ul>
<p>When you delete data within the extension, it is effective immediately and will remove selected records from our server.</p>

<p>If more than ten days have passed since data was collected, you can contact NYU CSMaP Engineers at csmap-engineers@nyu.edu to request your data be deleted. Please include the dates or times of collection you need deleted.</p>
