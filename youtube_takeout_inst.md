## Step 1: Request YouTube data from Google Takeout services

1. Visit this link: <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/youtube" target="new">https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/youtube</a>.
2. Scroll down to the section that says "Create a new export."
3. You will see the window "Select data to include" with Products listed as "Youtube and YouTube Music" (pictured below).
4. **Click on the option "All YouTube data included" - this is an important step that will allow you to limit the data that you share.**<br/>

- For Transfer to:, keep "Send download link via email" selected.
- For Frequency, choose "export once".
- For the File type field, select “.zip”.
- For File size field, select 1 GB. 
- Then click on the blue "Create export" button.
<br/> 
*Note: if your file size is larger than 1 GB, you most likely selected more data than requested. Please make sure you unselect “videos” in step 4.*

## Step 2: Wait for your takeout data to become available
After completing the Google takeout request, it should only be a few minutes before you receive the archive from Google in your inbox. On some rare occasions it can take a few days.

## Step 3: Download your YouTube takeout data
Check for an email from “Google Takeout” with the subject “Your Google data is ready to download.” This may take a while.
Download the zip file attachment from Google to your computer. 
<div style="padding-top:20px;"></div>
*Note for Mac users: If your downloaded file was unzipped by default, please rezip the file by right clicking on it, and selecting 'compress "your_takeout_filename"' from the dropdown.*

## Step 4: Submit your takeout data to receive points
**If you recieve your takeout data while you are filling out your survey, please use the Google form link provided in the survey to upload the zip file in the email you recieve from Google. You will also receive an email from YouGov with a link to the same Google form in 12-24 hours. If it takes more than a few minutes for you to recieve your data from Google, please use said YouGov email to send your data when it arrives.**
