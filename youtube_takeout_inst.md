2. Scroll down to the section that says **Create a new export**"
3. You will see the window **Select data to include** with Products listed as *Youtube and YouTube Music* (pictured below).

## Step 2: Wait for your takeout data to become available
After completing the Google takeout request, it should only be a few minutes before you receive the archive from Google in your inbox. On some rare occasions it can take a few days.

## Step 3: Download your YouTube takeout data
Check for an email from **Google Takeout** with the subject *Your Google data is ready to download*

Download the zip file attachment from Google to your computer. 

**Note** 

If your downloaded file was unzipped by default, please select all of the individual files within the folders inside the **YouTube and YouTube Music** folder which includes:

* search-history.html
* watch-history.html
* subscriptions.csv 
* comments.csv (This may not be available for your takeout) 

You will be uploading these files to the Google form in step 4 below
